    ABOUT THE VILLAGE

    The Village of Salisbury (population approx. 2000) is located in Southeast NB approximately 25 Km from the city of Moncton. With the Trans Canada Highway and CN railway passing through our community, the Salisbury Fire Dept has to be ready for any type of emergency. Our coverage area also covers a number of outlying communities such as Riverglade, Colpitts Settlement, Parkindale, Upper Coverdale and Boundary Creek. We are also part of a mutual aid agreement with (Petitcodiac, Havelock, Elgin, Penobsquis, Riverview and Moncton) neighboring departments for larger scale emergencies and water shuttle. Since our village does not incorporate a municipal water supply, there are no hydrants, therefore we must rely on local water sources such as ponds or streams and mutual aid.
